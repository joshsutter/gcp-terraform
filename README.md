# terraform-n00b
Terraforming things. 

This is simply my trip down Terraform lane with Google Cloud. You can create a Google account and have some free GCP credits to test all this stuff. Luckily, Terraform makes it incredibly easy to tear down after you're done so that you don't incur more charges. 

To get the stuff ready once you've put in your own variables. 
`terraform init`
`terraform plan`
`terraform apply`

When you want to tear down: `terraform destroy`
